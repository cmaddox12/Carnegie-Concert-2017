Composer Viktor Ullmann, born in 1898, briefly served in the military during WWI before studying music with Arnold Schönberg in Vienna and Alexander von Zemlinsky in Prague.  Of Jewish descent, Ullmann was deported to Theresienstadtby the Nazis in 1942, sent on to Auschwitz in 1944, and killed. 

The words of this enchanting love song were written by Iran's greatest poet, Hafis, at Shiraz during the 12th century. First translated into French, and then into German, they met Ullman and this composition while he was in Prague. The song demonstrates the universality of art and is a vehicle to explore the themes of SDGs 5 (gender equality) and 10 (social inclusion).
